## WaveletUtils.jl

A modernized adaptation of the `Util.jl` sub-package from [Wavelets.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDSP/Wavelets.jl).

## Installing

This package is in progress. Once I'm finished with it, I'll add it to the General registry.

## About

The current wavelet ecosystem in Julia is centralized around [Wavelets.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDSP/Wavelets.jl).
This package is part of an attempt to rewrite the Wavelet ecosystem:

- in modern (> v0.7) Julia
- in compartmentalized packages (in the same vein as the [JuliaDiff](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/) ecosystem)
- with complete, easy-to-understand documentation
- with extensible, Julian building blocks
