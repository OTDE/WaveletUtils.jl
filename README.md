## WaveletUtils.jl

A modernized adaptation of the `Util.jl` sub-package from [Wavelets.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDSP/Wavelets.jl).

## Installing

This package is in progress. Once I'm finished with it, I'll add it to the General registry.

## About

The current wavelet ecosystem in Julia is centralized around [Wavelets.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDSP/Wavelets.jl).
This package is the first part of an attempt to rewrite the Wavelet ecosystem with modern Julia.
